Creates a copy of an object graph with objects converted into maps of the object
properties and consisting solely of maps, lists and scalars where a scalar is a
primitive or string. Maps and lists are copied, arrays are converted into lists,
primitives objects and strings are left as is, and any other object that lacks a
custom conversion strategy is converted into a map by copying object's fields
and bean properties into a map. A diffused object graph is diffused because it
removes type informaiton and converts data into primitive, but univeral types.
<p>
This format is useful when you wish to serialize data in a format that can be
universally read or written. This is often the case when you have utilities that
are only interested in the objects data and not in the objects behavior. It is
often the natural order of things in languages like Javascript or Perl where
objects are really maps with methods.
<p>
For example, imagine you want to create a tree view of an object graph for
debugging purposes. The tree view would let you explore the contents of an
object graph, expanding object members as branches, and inspecting those
members, until you reach an atomic type such as a integer. Yes, Integer does
have properties in Java, but lets say that we're content to ignore those.
<p>
We could build the introspection into the tree viewer. Then the tree viewer
would have to interact with a special object model that would wrap an object and
present its fields and bean properties as name value pairs to be displayed in
our tree view.
<p>
Alternatively, we can use this library to diffuse the object, then have the tree
viewer display the contents of a tree that contains only two different container
types, maps and lists.
<p>
This is how diffuse is used in Notice. Notice is a logging API that creates
structured logging messages, that capture object graphs during operation. It
takes a snapshot of an object graph that can then be recorded by any Java
serialization tool that can understand Java maps and lists. Not need to wade
through a dozen different bean mapping strategis, simply convert to a diffused
object graph and the contents can be written in YAML, JSON or sent in a nicely
formatted email via SMTP.
